With almost no vibrations, good low-end torque, decent top-speed, very good build-quality and an astonishing tank range of 600+ km, Mahindra Mojo can be considered the best all-round touring bike available in India right now. It is still a mystery why Mahindra doesn't market it enough! That also means number of service centers are less.",

        "Despite every manufacturer trying to get hold of the Adventure Tourer market in India, the Royal Enfield Himalayan is still the only serious Adventure Tourer available under 4 lakh rupees. With every other manufacturer taking up an engine from their already available street bike, RE upped the game by building a long stroke engine solely for Adventure Touring. This also means that the sweet spot you can cruise in the Himalayan is lower at 80-90 kmph, but that doesn't seem to be a deal breaker since Indian roads are anyway not good enough for the 100+ kmph range. If Ladakh is your dream, the Himalayan is the one to go for. The brakes are little spongy though!",

It has a better cruising speed than both the bikes above. The brakes are also great. It's a very refined bike, but not as refined as the Mojo or the Himalayan. Bajaj has ensured a very good service network and parts availability but the build quality is comparitively lower.",

Apart from the loss in engine displacement, you will miss out on some fancy features of the 390. But you will still have a pocket rocket in your garage if you opt to buy this one.",
